Caden LeCluyse: 5-6:15, 1.25 hours. Split all files into header and cpp files. Changed raw pointers to shared pointers and raw arrays to std::array. Started including header files instead of cpp files. Changed makefile to account for header files. Changed some ints to std::size_t. Got the program to compile.

9/13/2024:
Caden LeCluyse: 3:15-3:45, 30 minutes. Converted all ints to size_t except the number of ships. We could convert numShips to an unsigned int to avoid casting or we can just cast it like I did.
