Estimate for hours completing this project:


Setup: 6 hours (inital setup of the battleship board.  Need to create game boards, a way for the user to choose where to put the ships)
Game process: 5 hours (actual game loop.  Need to keep track of ships and what locations are hits or misses)
End game: 2 hours (how do we know when to end the game?)
